# Editing the Docs

Edit the existing markdown documents directly, and regenerate the build folder using `make html`.

The Table of Contents is defined by `index.rst` in the root. 

To deploy edits, simply commit to master and check your edits [here](https://connext.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

## Readthedocs

These docs are made with readthedocs and sphinx, see the getting started guide [here](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/intro/getting-started-with-sphinx.html#external-resources).
